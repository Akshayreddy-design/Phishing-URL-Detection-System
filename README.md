# Phishing URL Detection using Machine Learning

# Overview

Phishing is one of the most dangerous cyberattacks targeting unsuspecting users by mimicking legitimate websites. This project aims to proactively detect phishing URLs using a "Gradient Boosting Classifier", coupled with intelligent feature extraction from URLs.

This system includes:
- Robust model with 97% accuracy
- Real-time Flask-based web app
- Comparative analysis of ML algorithms
- Fully interactive interface (Login, Upload, Result pages)

# Machine Learning Models Used

-  Gradient Boosting Classifier ("Best Performing")
-  Random Forest
-  Logistic Regression
-  Support Vector Machine (SVM)
-  K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

# Web App Features

- "Login Page": Simple admin access (Username: `admin`, Password: `admin`)
- "Upload Page": Upload `.csv` or `.xlsx` dataset
- "Prediction Page": Enter a URL and get phishing probability instantly
-  Visualizations:
  - Confusion matrix
  - Pie chart of phishing vs legitimate URLs
